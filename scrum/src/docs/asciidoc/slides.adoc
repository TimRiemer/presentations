== Agile Manifesto

[verse, http://agilemanifesto.org/]
--
*Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
*Working software* over comprehensive documentation
*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
*Responding to change* over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right,
we value the items on the left more.
